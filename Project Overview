This project aims to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior. The steps involved are as follows:

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Gathered a dataset containing customers' purchase histories.
Cleaned the data by handling missing values and standardizing the format.
Feature Selection:

Selected relevant features that capture the purchasing behavior of customers.
Model Implementation:

Implemented the K-means clustering algorithm using Python libraries such as scikit-learn.
Determined the optimal number of clusters using methods like the Elbow method and Silhouette score.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluated the clustering results and analyzed the characteristics of each customer segment.
Visualized the clusters to gain insights into customer behavior.
